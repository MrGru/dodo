# Project agent memory

`dodo` is a Rust desktop app: a single window with a collapsible sidebar, where each sidebar
entry swaps the main pane to a self-contained developer tool (JSON formatter, Encoder/Decoder,
API Explorer) plus a Settings dialog. It is built on GPUI (Zed's UI framework) and the `gpui-component` widget
library, both pulled from git and pinned only by `Cargo.lock`. See `README.md` for the user-facing
description and `Cargo.toml` for exact dependency sources.

Read `src/main.rs` for the startup sequence and `src/layout.rs` for the view model; the doc
comments there are the authority on structure. This file is only a map.

Most tools are a single `src/<tool>.rs`. **`src/api_explorer/` is the exception** and the pattern
to copy when a tool outgrows one file: `models/` (plain data, no GPUI, unit tested), `services/`
(the `Transport` trait — the only place that may name `reqwest`), `state/`, `components/`,
`views/`. Its `mod.rs` doc comments explain the split and where later phases plug in. It is also
the only tool that registers a key binding (`api_explorer::init`, called from `main` after
`gpui_component::init`, same ordering rule as `settings::init`).

## Skills

Detailed, verified knowledge lives in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Load one when its trigger
fires — they are written to be read at the moment of need, not up front.

| Skill | Load it when |
|---|---|
| `gpui-component-recipes` | Writing or editing any `render` / `new` that builds a gpui-component widget (input, code editor, diagnostics, select, dialog, settings panel, sidebar, button, icon); a widget call will not compile; or a widget builds but nothing appears on screen. |
| `dodo-tool-view` | Adding, renaming, reordering or removing a sidebar tool; a new sidebar entry does not appear or renders blank. |
| `dodo-i18n-text` | Writing or changing **any** text a user reads — a label, title, placeholder, description, error, dropdown option; or an `i18n` / `i18n_lint` test fails. |
| `dodo-theming-settings` | Adding or changing a setting, adding or removing a theme or a language, or a settings change does not apply until restart. |
| `dodo-build-validate` | First `cargo` invocation of a session, adding tests, a build or `cargo test` failing oddly, or being asked whether a UI change actually works. |

Two things that catch everyone and belong here rather than behind a trigger:

- **`Cargo.lock` is the only pin on the four git dependencies.** `cargo update` silently jumps
  them to upstream HEAD. Never run it as a side effect of another task.
- **The pinned `gpui-component` source is the reference for every widget question**, at
  `~/.cargo/git/checkouts/gpui-component-*/<rev>/crates/ui/src` (rev from `Cargo.lock`). Its
  `<checkout>/skills/` directory holds the upstream authors' own guidance, which is excellent on
  GPUI fundamentals and stale in a few places — `gpui-component-recipes` records which.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
